# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

If you have found an issue or would like to request a new feature, simply create a new issue detailing the request. We also welcome pull requests. See below for information on getting started with development and submitting pull requests.


## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ariyoaresa/canteen/issues/new). Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/ariyoaresa/canteen/issues) or [open a new one](https://github.com/ariyoaresa/canteen/issues/new)
2. Fork this repository
3. Create a new branch
4. Make the changes on your branch.
5. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main repository.
   We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**.


### Commit Message

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:

- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add support for dark mode"
